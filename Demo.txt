The term 'Inheritance' is derived from the word "Inherit" which
 means, 
"to derive any quality, features or characteristics from family".
 Therefore, "Inheritance is defined as a mechanism where the sub 
 or child 
 class inherits the properties and characteristics of the super 
 class or other derived classes. 
It also supports additional features of 
extracting properties from the child class and using 
it into other derived classes."

 You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of 
 methods declared with or without an implementation.
 However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that 
 are not static and final, and define public, protected, 
 and private concrete methods.
